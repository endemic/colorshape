Things to do
============

* Balance gameplay
	* Change level progression to be based on # of matches, not points (advantage being that fast players can get higher scores
	  before the level counter increases) [DONE]
	* Slow down the combo counter decrement slightly [DONE]

BUGS
---------
* Figure out how to re-enable "Leaderboards" button when player becomes authenticated outside of app


Improvements for next update
============================

* Try to have a "disappear" animation for each block
* When row or column is touched, the blocks grow by 10% or something to help show which row/column is moving
* Add status message at center point of match, telling what sort of match was made
