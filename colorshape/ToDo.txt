Things to do
============

* Create large "More Games" button on title screen
* Change "Reset data" button to use NSAlert popup
* Fix particle positions
* Look into vertical matches not completely disappearing
* Change animation for blocks sliding into place [DONE]
* Fix music playing on title screen [DONE]

Improvements for next update
============================

* Try to have a "disappear" animation for each block
* When row or column is touched, the blocks grow by 10% or something to help show which row/column is moving
* Add status message at center point of match, telling what sort of match was made
