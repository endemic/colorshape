* Add a confirmation to the score reset
* Add "disabled" leaderboard button

BUGS

* Figure out how to re-enable "Leaderboards" button when player becomes authenticated outside of app


Improvements for next update
============================

* Try to have a "disappear" animation for each block
* When row or column is touched, the blocks grow by 10% or something to help show which row/column is moving
* Add status message at center point of match, telling what sort of match was made
