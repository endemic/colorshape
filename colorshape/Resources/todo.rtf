Things to do\
============\
\
* Balance gameplay\
	* Chain counter runs down too quickly or else regular matches don't give enough time back\
	* Make sure level progression is working correctly\
\
* Fix initial block generation so there are no matches starting off\
* Store matches in their own arrays - have two simultaneous matches increase the combo multiplier\
	* Add status message at center point of match\
	* Generate only one particle emitter per match\
* Add a confirmation modal to the score reset\
\
\
BUGS\
---------\
* Figure out how to re-enable "Leaderboards" button when player becomes authenticated outside of app\
* Touches near the top of the block grid trigger a crash (fixed?)\
\
\
## Improvements for next update ##\
* Try to have a "disappear" animation for each block and then just one particle emitter}
