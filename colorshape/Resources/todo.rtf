Things to do\
============\
\
* Fix top UI background labels - old graphic was 320x152, new is 320 x 160 - move 'em up 8px\
* Fix retina "scores" display\
* Move "Leaderboards" button to the high score view\
* Add "info" button + view (Designed and programmed by Nathan Demick)\
* Fix retina "+ time" label\
* Add "Ready?" "Go" text\
* Learn about app localization\
\
\
GAME DESIGN\
-----------\
* Level increases after 60 seconds\
	* Higher levels mean you gain back fewer move points per match & combo counter counts down more quickly\
\
ART\
---\
* Create "How to play" image/text sequence\
	* Show hand/finger moving blocks around (Move blocks)\
	* Show checkmark after 4 same color blocks (Match colors!)\
	* Show checkmark after 4 shame shape blocks (Match shapes!)\
	\
* Re-work the "background 0" pattern\
\
SOUND/MUSIC\
---------\
* Create Game Over SFX or music\
\
PROGRAMMING\
-----------\
* Store matches in their own arrays - have two simultanious matches increase the combo multiplier\
	* This would also allow a status message at the location of the match\
\
WEIRDNESS\
---------\
* Figure out how to re-enable "Leaderboards" button when player becomes authenticated outside of app\
